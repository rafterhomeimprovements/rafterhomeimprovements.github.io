  <p class="info-text">Hi Bob and Jane,
  <br>Sorry this is so late. We've been meaning to write for weeks... I'm sad that I didn't get to see you before you finished to thank you in person.
  <br>We love the bathroom. Kevin is sad because he doesn't get in there very often. The shower is a-ma-zing. We're very happy with your recommendations about how to lay the tiles. It looks fabulous. The way you laid the tile around the bathtub gives a more modern, clean look to the bathroom.<br>
  We want to thank you for your professionalism, honesty and meticulous attention to detail. We were extremely happy that you were done ahead of schedule and on budget. I was pleasantly surprised every day when I came home, you were gone and there was no mess. The only way I knew you had been there some days was because there was more work done. You need to know how much that sort of small detail is appreciated.
  <br>You also went the extra mile in sorting out a few issues with our supplier. In our line of work it's hard to always watch your phone. But when you couldn't reach us you made the extra efforts to keep things moving along. Thank you for that.
  <br>And thank you for being so good with Kobie. I think he really misses having some entertainment during the day while we're at work :)
  <br>Kelly & Kevin<p/>

  <p class="info-text"><strong>Nigel and Marti</strong></p>
  <p class="info-text">Dear Bob and Aaron,
  <br>Itâ€™s been such a pleasure having both of you work in our home. How many times do people say that about renos ?!!
  <br>Great job and thank you !!
  <br>Nigel and Marti</p>
